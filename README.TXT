The medium (CD/DVD/memory stick) contains the following folder structure:

1. Root directory
It contains all files for running the patient data burned on the medium with either the iQ-LITE viewer or from a web browser, including the instructions for use. It also contains the 'DICOMDIR', the main table of the database.

2. DICOM
In this folder are saved the DICOM image data. A specific folder structure is used: Each study is filed in a separate folder which is comprised of individual folders for the different series that are included in the study. The series folders then contain the individual images.

3. IHE_PDI
This folder contains the 'BANNER.JPG', which is used as a label for both the iQ-LITE viewer and the top of the INDEX.HTM page. Further you will find here the html sub-pages for study level and series level as well as the individual images as JPEG.

4. REPORTS
The DICOM structured reports in an html web view are stored here.

The medium (CD/DVD/memory stick) may include the iQ-LITE DICOM viewer version 3.2.

Information regarding the intended use of the software:

iQ-LITE is used for image viewing without diagnostic or therapeutic intention. It is a DICOM viewer software placed onto portable media, such as CD, DVD or memory stick and reads imaging studies that also exist on the medium. The portable media is created either by automated disc production systems or on workstations using a burning software for medical images such as iQ-VIEW/PRO.

Users of iQ-LITE are healthcare professionals, patients, private end-users and/or laymen. The typical location of application for the software is on computers of these user groups.
